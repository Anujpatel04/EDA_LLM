 AI Insights:
 From the summary of your dataset, here are some insights:

1. The dataset consists of 195 countries, each represented by a unique CountryName and CountryCode. However, some fields like BirthRate, InternetUsers, and IncomeGroup are missing values (NaN) for all rows.

2. The top country in terms of income group is Aruba (ABW), which falls under the High income category. This might imply that most countries in this dataset fall into lower-income groups if only four unique income groups are being considered.

3. The distribution of BirthRate and InternetUsers seems skewed, as indicated by their large standard deviations compared to the mean values. This suggests a wide range of birth rates and internet user counts across the countries in the dataset.

4. The minimum birth rate is 7.9, and the maximum is 49.66, indicating significant variation in birth rates among the countries. Similarly, the minimum number of internet users is 0.9, while the maximum is 96.5468, suggesting a wide range in internet penetration across these nations.

5. The median values for both BirthRate and InternetUsers are closer to the mean values, indicating that roughly half of the countries have birth rates and internet user counts slightly above or below the respective means.","[{""image"": "".gradio\\flagged\\Data Visualizations\\06fb2a7d07f73a343bc9\\BirthRate_distribution.png"", ""caption"": null}, {""image"": "".gradio\\flagged\\Data Visualizations\\abce072bcfc2adb378e0\\InternetUsers_distribution.png"", ""caption"": null}, {""image"": "".gradio\\flagged\\Data Visualizations\\79eae4033c930f3deaf0\\correlation_heatmap.png"", ""caption"": null}]",2025-03-07 22:18:48.689153
